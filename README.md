# <h2>Prediction using Unsupervised ML-Kmeans Clustering <h2>
The Iris dataset is clustered into 3 different clusters based on their features and also visually represented using a scatterplot. The most popular unsupervised learning algorithm, K-Means Clustering is used for this purpose here. Also, the elbow method is used to determine the number of optimal number of clusters.
